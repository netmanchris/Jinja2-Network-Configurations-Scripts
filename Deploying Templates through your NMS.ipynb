    "\n",
    "If you look closely, we've actually got an extra VLAN in there. **VLAN 5** has been configured on the device, but it's not in our list of desired_vlans where we have declared exactly which VLANs should be on the target device. This is what is sometimes known as configuration drift. Some people may say \n",

    "## Vendor Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The other problem with this example is that we are bound to a specific vendor's syntax. If you attmept to run the **system-view** command on a Juniper/Cisco/Brocade/Extreme/ARISTA device, it's going to error out. Right?  This coule easily be addressed by some conditional logic which figures out which kind of a box it is first and then leverages a specific Jinja template for that vendor, but you can see how this becomes a slippery slope rather quickly. \n",
